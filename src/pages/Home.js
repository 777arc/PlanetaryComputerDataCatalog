          The Planetary Computer combines a multi-petabyte catalog of global
          environmental data with intuitive APIs, a flexible scientific
          environment that allows users to answer global questions about that
          data, and applications that put those answers in the hands of
          conservation stakeholders. With the launch of the Planetary Computer,
          Microsoft and our partners are closing the gap between global
          environmental data and sustainability decision-making.

        <Resource title="Hub">
          The Planetary Computer Hub is a development environment that makes our
          data and APIs accessible through familiar, open-source tools, and
          allows users to easily scale their analyses with the power of Azure
          compute.

          Together with our partners in the conservation community, we are
          putting the Planetary Computer in the hands of stakeholders through
          applications that build on top of the Planetary Computer platform,
          providing the actionable information that is critical to
          sustainability practitioners.
