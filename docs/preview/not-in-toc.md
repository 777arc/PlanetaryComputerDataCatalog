# An example preview doc

## This doc

This document does not have an entry in the index.md TOC file, and includes
the file metadata `orphan`. As a result, it will not show up in the table of
contents and will not generate a warning at build, but can be accessed via
direct URL at docs/preview/not-in-toc.

## Other docs

Add additional files in this directory to preview documentation without
having it listed in the table of contents. Be sure to include the `orphan` frontmatter.
