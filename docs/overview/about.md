# About the Microsoft Planetary Computer

The Microsoft Planetary Computer is a platform that lets users leverage the power of the [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) cloud to accelerate environmental sustainability and Earth science.

The Planetary Computer consists of four major components:
- The [Data Catalog](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog), which includes petabytes of data about Earth systems, hosted on Azure and made available to users for free.
- [APIs](../concepts/stac.md) that allow users to search for the data they need across space and time.
- The [Hub](../concepts/computing.md), a fully managed computing environment that allows scientists to process massive geospatial datasets.
- [Applications](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/applications), built by our network of partners, that put the Planetary Computer platform to work for environmental sustainability.

## Built on Open

The Planetary Computer is built to operate on open data, using open-source tools, and supporting open standards. You'll notice that a lot of our documentation demonstrates the use of open-source tools to interact with our data, APIs, and computing environment to extract and analyze spatial data.  The foundation of the Planetary Computer is the incredible ecosystem of tools being developed in the open by our partners and the much broader-open source community.

## About Private Preview

While the Planetary Computer data and APIs are publicly accessible, certain features of the Planetary Computer are in Private Preview and require access be granted. Use the [request access form](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/account/request) to express your interest in becoming an early user.

We're just getting started. Check back for updated documentation and new features!
